                <h1 id="sd2-analysis-and-reverse-engineering">SD2 analysis and reverse engineering</h1>
<p>Published: 2024-03-04</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Sistema Diagnosi 2</strong> (or <strong>SD2</strong>) is an automotive diagnostic tool developed by Digitek under contract to Ferrari in the mid-1990s, and it is designed to interface with ECUs in both Ferrari and Maserati vehicles built around that time. The SD2 consists of Windows-based software (<strong>WSDC32</strong>) that runs on a PC, a piece of custom hardware in the form of a tablet-like computer called the <strong>Tester</strong>, and a collection of cables that connect the Tester to one of the dozens of different ECUs that the system supports.</p>
<p>In the interest of preserving the capabilities of the SD2 and making them available to DIY-minded enthusiasts, I decided to reverse-engineer the system and document my findings. This article is an attempt to document the design and function of the SD2 itself, but I am also working on open-source libraries that implement several of the diagnostic protocols used by SD2-supported ECUs. These include Keyword Protocol 71 ("KWP-71"), FIAT-9141, and Marelli 1AF.</p>
<h3 id="naming-convention">Naming convention</h3>
<p>Each ECU supported by SD2 is internally given a unique ID string that is used to label files and directories. The strings are eight characters long and in the format <code>MDDD####</code>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>M</code> is a single-character representation of the manufacturer (e.g. <code>B</code> for Bosch)</li>
<li><code>DDD</code> is a three-character abbreviation of the type of ECU. Sometimes this is from the Italian word, such as <code>ANT</code> for <em>antifurto</em> (anti-theft), and sometimes it is a product name such as <code>MOT</code> for Motronic.</li>
<li><code>####</code> is a zero-prefixed decimal number. These numbers seem to be globally unique in the list of supported ECUs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>BMOT0145 for the Bosch Motronic 5.2 as found in the F355</li>
<li>BSOS0088 for the Bilstein suspension ECU as found in the 550</li>
<li>MCAM0151 for the Marelli gearbox ECU as found in the 355 F1</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tester">Tester</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tester</strong> is a piece of custom hardware roughly the size of a laptop computer, and it's the component of the system that interfaces directly with the diagnostic ports in the cars. I was able to learn a lot about its design by analyzing the Tester filesystem image that is provided with the SD2 software package. The Tester is built around a Motorola 68360 QICC processor (the "CPU32" architecture). It runs a VxWorks 5 image that provides the core functionality for processing keypad input as well as managing the Tester's display, filesystem, and serial ports. It also handles serial connections from the Windows PC.</p>
<p>To add support for a particular ECU to the SD2, the Windows-based software must be used to load a binary module to the Tester. Many (but not all) ECUs may have diagnostics run from the Tester while it is in "standalone" mode (which is only useful if diagnostics must be performed with the car driving and no laptop is available.) For certain ECUs, diagnostics can only be run with the Tester tethered to the Windows PC.</p>
<p>The VxWorks loadable binary modules (each supporting a different ECU) are supplied as files with the <code>.ecu</code> extension. My analysis of these files showed that they're of the antiquated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.out">A.out executable format</a>, which was used on UNIX-like systems until the 1990s. I was using <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> to analyze the Tester's main VxWorks image, but since Ghidra lacked support for A.out, I had to write it myself. I've made the A.out support available on the branch tracked by <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/5004">this pull request</a>.</p>
<p>The Tester has a couple different types of ports for connecting to an ECU. Two of these ports, labeled "ISO1" and "ISO2", use the common half-duplex 12V/0V signalling scheme that is associated with the ISO9141 standard. These ISO connections use a signal line (the "K-line") and a GND. Sometimes -- depending on the ECU -- a second signal line called the "L-line" is used for initialization. Many of the in-car connectors are a three-pin design that was common across FIAT, Alfa, and Lancia products at the time, and the three pins map to K, L, and GND.</p>
<h2 id="wsdc32">WSDC32</h2>
<p>The software that runs on the Windows PC is named <strong>WSDC32</strong>, and it consists of a couple parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A main application that is responsible for loading ECU support files to the Tester.</li>
<li>ECU-specific child applications that are launched from the main application. Each of these applications contains the code that sends commands through the Tester to a connected ECU for the purpose of requesting parameters, reading fault codes, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tester-to-pc-serial-connection">Tester-to-PC serial connection</h2>
<p>When WSDC32 and the Tester are connected via an RS232 link, they communicate using a message-based software protocol. Each of these messages has the same header structure, with fields to give the total message length and identify the message type. The messages provide the ability to draw to the Tester's screen, read or write the filesystem in the Tester's flash memory, and start/stop ECU diagnostics.</p>
<p>Fields in message header:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Byte index</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>00</td>

<tr>

<td>16-bit big endian count of bytes in this message (including this field, but <em>not</em> including the prefix byte before it). Although the size of this field implies that this protocol allows messages up to 64K bytes in size, the Tester will only send/receive messages with the high byte fixed to 00, limiting the total message size to 0xff bytes.</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The message types sent between the PC and the Tester are divided into several different categories, and each of these categories is handled by a different thread running on the Tester. When a message is received by the Tester, it is directed to the appropriate thread by being placed into one of several VxWorks pipes, as indicated by the byte in the message's header at offset 6 that gives the pipe ID:</p>

<h3 id="response-messages-from-tester">Response messages from Tester</h3>
<p>In general, if the Tester only needs to ack a command or send a generic "success" response, the response will be 8 bytes long and take the following form:</p>
<p><code>54  00  07  xx  xx  xx  xx  01</code></p>
<p>Note that this ack message preserves the values from the original command (i.e. the request to which it is replying) in positions 03 through 06 (represented as <code>xx</code> above). Byte 00 is updated with the Tester's link-to-PC mode prefix byte (which is 0x54). Bytes 01-02 are updated to contain the new byte count (0x0007, in this case). An eighth byte is added to contain the value 0x01, which indicates success.</p>
<p>When interrogating a connected ECU that speaks a protocol such as KWP71, the Tester essentially acts as a passthrough. KWP71 blocks are sent by WSDC32 by way of SD2 message type 0x13, and the blocks are forwarded on to the ECU. When the ECU responds, the Tester will encapsulate the response with the SD2 serial message header and send it back to WSDC32.</p>
<p>A response that relays KWP-71 data received from the ECU looks like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<h2 id="tester-filesystem">Tester filesystem</h2>
<p>The Tester has flash memory which it mounts at /FN0. Within this, it stores ECU support files that were transferred to it by WSDC32. As an example, when <code>BMOT0145</code> is loaded to the Tester, these files will be created:</p>
<ul>
<li>/FN0/ecu/BMOT0145.ECU</li>
<li>/FN0/ecu/BMOT0145_TESTER.TXT</li>
<li>/FN0/ecu/SCARICO.INI</li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration file <code>SCARICO.INI</code> is updated with an additional section for each ECU module that is added, up to the maximum supported by the Tester (which is 64 modules). With this one example module, the .ini file would have the following content:</p>
<pre><code>[CONFIG]
n_ecu=1
ecu1=0145
[0145]
name=MOTRONIC BOSCH 5.2 F355
dir=BMOT0145
exe=BMOT0145.ECU
stringhe=BMOT0145_TESTER.TXT
linea_iso1=TRUE
linea_iso2=TRUE
linea_can=FALSE
linea_rs232=FALSE
</code></pre>
<h2 id="ecus-and-protocols">ECUs and protocols</h2>
<p>The <code>.ecu</code> file that is loaded to the Tester to provide support for an ECU actually contains the implementation of the software protocol that the ECU speaks. For example, the Motronic 5.2 ECU in the F355 speaks KWP71, so <code>BMOT0145.ECU</code> contains an implementation of KWP71 compiled into an A.out executable for the VxWorks-based Tester. Another ECU (such as the Motronic in the 512TR) may also use KWP71 -- but its support package includes a separate <code>.ecu</code> file with another implementation of KWP71. The advantage to this design is that each ECU may have minor differences in their implementation of protocols, and this can be accommodated by the individual <code>.ecu</code> files. The disadvantage is that the protocol implementations are often redundant, being replicated in each <code>.ecu</code> module.</p>
<p>To successfully perform diagnostics on an ECU, it is not only necessary to know the protocol being used, but also the location/address at which each parameter is stored, as well as the formula to convert the in-memory values to the appropriate physical units. For example, the F355 Motronic 5.2 stores engine RPM in a single byte at address 0x2001 with a value of 40 RPM per LSB.</p>
